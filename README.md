I'm Julian, a software developer specializing in Rust and testing.
I'm working on [Owl Duty](https://owlduty.com), a SaaS to monitor and test APIs around the world. Its core library, [Grillon](https://github.com/owlduty/grillon), is open source!

I also make video games in my free time, which that you can check on [Indiedevcasts](https://indiedevcasts.com).
